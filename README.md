openLRS868
=========

My fork of openLRS code (based on  kha's OpenLRSng)

This is customized for my personal DIY LongRange RC control with the following hardware setup:

- 16MHz Arduino Nano 328p
- RFM23BP 868MHz RF-Module

This system is built to comply to European ETSI regulations concerning the use of the ~870 MHz SRD band since the standard UHF 433 MHz band cannot be used legally without a HAM operators license.
